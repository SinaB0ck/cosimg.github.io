For the past ten years we have developed conflict simulations for a wide range of application in academic education and employed them in class. They range from simple, small-scale simulations designed to illustrate a specific aspect of a political or military conflict of the past to large and complex simulations aimed at providing participants with some experience of general issues related to political and military decision making. These participants usually are either students in our *Digital Humanities* BA and MA programs or military officers and officer candidates. 

## Selected developments

### Pluie de Balles

The largest and most complex simulation we currently employ is an army corps level simulation called *Pluie de Balles* or PdB for short. PdB is aimed both at university students and at other early-career decision makers, both military and civilian. It is designed to expose the participants to some of the friction that is caused by having to process information, make decisions and communicate under stress, as well as to test the limits of the participants' capability of working together as a team. We have run PdB successfully on a regular basis with groups of up to 40 or more participants from both a civilian and a military background. Despite its slightly unusual setting - PdB scenarios are usually based on [Victorian invasion novel literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_literature) - participants regularly describe their experiences as highly illuminating though, due to the stress involved, not always exactly enjoyable. 

The rule set - though inspired by the historical [Prussian Kriegsspiel](https://cosimg.github.io/blog/2022/04/24/player-of-the-month-intro.html) - is designed for scalability. It allows for 2-3 facilitators to easily accommodate 40+ players, but on the other hand requires some knowledge about rules and game mechanisms on the players' side.

A more detailed description of *Pluie de Balles* and other simulations developed by us will follow soon. A brief overview over PdB and its purpose can be found in our publication [*Pluie de Balles - complex wargames in the classroom*](http://analoggamestudies.org/2018/09/pluie-de-balles-complex-wargames-in-the-classroom/).


### Sussex Sorrows

*Sussex Sorrows*, a real-time operational wargame with a strong emphasis on communication, information processing and staff work, that is also set in a [Victorian invasion novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_literature) scenario. It is closely modeled after the original [Prussian Kriegsspiel](https://cosimg.github.io/blog/2022/04/24/player-of-the-month-intro.html) and requires an umpire-to-player ratio of about 1:3. Much like the Prussian original *Sussex Sorrows* easily allows for the depiction of multiple command levels on the player side. Scenarios usually depict large-scale, multi-day battles on army corps level. 

### Twelve Days to London

Yet another game rooted in the British late 19th century invasion scares is *Twelve Days to London*. This is turn-based, theatre-level operational wargame played on a map that includes most of southern England. Gaming mechanisms are also umpired-based and very closely modeled after the [Prussian Kriegsspiel](https://cosimg.github.io/blog/2022/04/24/player-of-the-month-intro.html). However, due to its turn-based design - players receive collected messages and intel from their formation commanders and hand in detailed orders once a day - *Twelve Days to London* is is especially suited for Email-based online games.
